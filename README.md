## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Issue Tracker App up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Flutter SDK:** [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
-   **Android Studio / VS Code:** With the official Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
-   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required for Android development.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/suvojit213/issue_tracker.git
    cd issue_tracker
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure all necessary packages are installed by running:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Configure Android Permissions:**

    Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and verify that the internet permission is included inside the `<manifest>` tag, *before* the `<application>` tag:

    ```xml
    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
        <!-- Add other necessary permissions here, e.g., for notifications -->
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
        <application
            android:label="issue_tracker_app"
            android:name="${applicationName}"
            android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
            <!-- ... other application settings ... -->
        </application>
    </manifest>
    ```

4.  **Generate a Keystore (for Release Builds):**

    To sign your Android APKs consistently, generate a keystore. **Keep this file and its passwords secure.**

    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias <your-key-alias>
    ```
    Replace `<your-key-alias>` with your desired alias (e.g., `mykey`). Remember the keystore password and key password.

5.  **Configure `key.properties`:**

    Create a file named `key.properties` in the `android/` directory (at the same level as `build.gradle.kts`) with the following content, replacing placeholders with your actual keystore details:

    ```properties
    storePassword=<YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD>
    keyPassword=<YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD>
    keyAlias=<YOUR_KEY_ALIAS>
    storeFile=<PATH_TO_YOUR_KEYSTORE_FILE>/keystore.jks
    ```
    **Important:** Ensure `key.properties` is added to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.

6.  **Set up GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD):**

    For automated builds via GitHub Actions, you need to securely store your keystore and passwords as repository secrets.
    -   Base64 encode your `keystore.jks` file: `base64 keystore.jks`
    -   In your GitHub repository, go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` and add the following secrets:
        -   `KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Paste the base64 encoded string.
        -   `KEY_ALIAS`: Your key alias (e.g., `mykey`).
        -   `KEY_PASSWORD`: Your key password.
        -   `STORE_PASSWORD`: Your keystore password.

### Running the App

1.  **Connect a device or start an emulator.**
2.  **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Running Tests

To execute the project's tests, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter test
```
